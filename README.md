# 1. About DP-600 Exam
Share my experience of learning the course and taking the exam

- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/) is very important. Yes, I mean this online help. Almost all the answers or testing points can be found there.
- It is essential to practice Python, SQL, and PowerBI(DAX) regularly. The experience from daily work can be very helpful.

  There are a quite few questions regarding **deployment**. E.g. When you move the DataLake from DEV to QAS, do you think its security rule will be moved up automatically? 
- Having the Fabric platform is critical. It is better to get a real environment. It is a good choice to get a 1 year free Azure trial system.
- The exam consists of two sections **Questions** (**51** questions) and **Case Study** (**10** questions). You complete the first part before moving on to the second. Once you proceed to the **Case Study** section, you **CANNOT** return to the **Questions** section and make changes.
- You need to manage your time effectively. I didn't review my answers at the end. This was my strategy.

> [!NOTE]
> BTW, I only had 5 minutes left after completing all the questions, which means that I can only review and change the answoers to the **Case Study** questions in the 5 minutes.
